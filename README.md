# thisoldtoolbox-linux
This repo is part of my This Old Toolbox set of repos, which collectively host various system administration/management tools I've written over the years, for a variety of platforms and environments. I'm making them public so that others might find the ideas and/or the accumulated knowledge helpful to whatever they need to create.

# Documentation
These tools have extensive in-line documentation in the form of comments.

# Code Style
All over the place, really. In my newer BASH code, I try to follow the [GoogleBASH Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html). For Python, I make an effort to adhere to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). However, I value good commenting above following a specific code style.

# Warranty
Absolutely none at all. I stand by my work, yes, but I wrote these things for the environment in which I operated at the time. It probably isn't your environment. If you try to use any of my tools without taking the time to examine and understand the code, you're asking for trouble.
